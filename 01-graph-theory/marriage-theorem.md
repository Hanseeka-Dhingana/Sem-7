## 🌸 1. The Story — “The Marriage Party”

Imagine there’s a small town with **three boys** and **three girls**:

* Boys: A, B, C
* Girls: X, Y, Z

Each boy only wants to marry someone he *knows*.
If there’s an edge (a line) between a boy and a girl, it means **they know each other**.

Let’s say:

| Boy | Girls he knows |
| --- | -------------- |
| A   | X, Y           |
| B   | Y, Z           |
| C   | X, Z           |


## 💭 2. What’s the Question?

We want to know:

> Can all the boys get married to different girls they know — so that no two boys marry the same girl?

That’s the essence of **Hall’s Marriage Problem**.


## 🎯 3. The Goal in Graph Terms

We have a **bipartite graph** — two sets of vertices:

* Left side (boys): A, B, C
* Right side (girls): X, Y, Z
* Edges connect who knows whom.

We want to find a **perfect matching** — every boy is matched with one unique girl.


## 🔍 4. Hall’s Condition (the Rule)

Hall’s Theorem says:

> A perfect matching exists **if and only if**
> for every group of boys, the number of girls they know is **at least as many as** the number of boys.

Formally:
For every subset ( S ) of boys,

$$
|N(S)| \ge |S|
$$

where ( N(S) ) means “the girls this group of boys knows.”

## 🧮 5. Let’s Check This Example Step-by-Step

| Group of boys (S) | Girls they know (N(S)) | \|N(S)\| | \|S\| | OK? |
|------------------|------------------------|----------|-------|------|
| {A}              | {X, Y}                 | 2        | 1     | ✅   |
| {B}              | {Y, Z}                 | 2        | 1     | ✅   |
| {C}              | {X, Z}                 | 2        | 1     | ✅   |
| {A, B}           | {X, Y, Z}              | 3        | 2     | ✅   |
| {A, C}           | {X, Y, Z}              | 3        | 2     | ✅   |
| {B, C}           | {X, Y, Z}              | 3        | 2     | ✅   |
| {A, B, C}        | {X, Y, Z}              | 3        | 3     | ✅   |

✅ **Every subset satisfies** (|N(S)| \ge |S|).
So the condition holds → a perfect matching exists.


## 💍 6. The Result (The Matching)

One possible set of marriages:

* A → Y
* B → Z
* C → X

Everyone gets a partner — perfect!


## 🚫 7. What If the Rule Breaks?

Let’s slightly change it:

| Boy | Girls he knows |
| --- | -------------- |
| A   | X              |
| B   | X              |
| C   | Y              |

Now, group (S = {A, B}) both only know girl X.

$$
|S| = 2, \quad |N(S)| = 1.
$$

❌ (1 < 2) → Hall’s condition **fails**,
so it’s impossible for both A and B to marry different girls.
(She can only marry one of them!)


## 🌈 8. Why It’s So Beautiful

Hall’s Theorem gives a **simple test** to know if a perfect one-to-one pairing is possible in any bipartite situation — not just marriage!

It applies to:

* Assigning **workers to jobs** (if each worker qualifies for certain jobs)
* Matching **students to schools**
* Matching **tasks to processors** in computing
* And many more real-world allocation problems.


## 🧠 9. One-Line Summary

> **If every group of boys knows at least as many girls as the group’s size, then everyone can find a unique match.**
