### Fundamentals of Graph Theory
Notations: Graph, vertices, loop, degree, 


- ✅ Graphs: Simple, multi, isolated, pandent, mix, directed, undirected, weighted, pseudo, sub, adjacent, incidence
- ✅ in/out degree, handshake theorem, 
- Complete graph: Notations, examples, similar, use cases, formula, finding edges
- Compltete Bipartite/Bipartite graph, wheel, regular, isomorphism (subjective, bijective)
- Matrices: Adjacent, incidence
- Ringsum, bridge
- Spanning tree, Prim's, Kruskal, Dijkstra, A*, Bellman Ford, BFS, DFS 
- Euler (Path, Circuit), Hamiltonion (Path, Circuit)
    - TODO: Vertex and Edge rules in both
- Mathematical Inductive proof of Euler
    - R = | E | - | V | - 2
    - Region: Acycle in a graph
- Graph Traversal
- Graph Coloring
- Tree Traversal
- Chinese Postman
    - Non-Eulerian to Eulerian
    - weighted, unweighted, directed, undirected
    - Odd Factorial
