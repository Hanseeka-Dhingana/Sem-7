Horizontal orientation arranges views left to right, perfect for toolbars and navigation menus.

- Combining Orientations
Combining different orientations in nested LinearLayouts creates complex layouts but should avoid deep nesting for performance.


## KEY ATTRIBUTES OF LINEARLAYOUT

### ESSENTIAL XML ATTRIBUTES

- Layout Size Attributes
android:layout_width and android:layout_height define the size of the LinearLayout container.

- Orientation and Weight
android:orientation sets child arrangement direction; layout_weight distributes space proportionally among children.

- Alignment and Baseline
android:layout_gravity aligns children within parent; baselineAligned controls text baseline alignment among children.


### USING LAYOUT_WEIGHT AND WEIGHTSUM

- Layout_weight Function
layout_weight assigns space proportionally to child views based on assigned weight values in LinearLayout.

- WeightSum Role
weightSum defines the total weight for the parent layout to distribute space precisely among children.

- Adaptive UI Design
Using these attributes creates flexible UIs that adjust well to various screen sizes and orientations.

- Best Practices
Proper use avoids unexpected layout behavior and ensures visual balance and usability in applications.

### PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION | XML EXAMPLES OF LINEARLAYOUT

- Basic LinearLayout Structure
LinearLayout arranges child views in a single direction, either vertically or horizontally.

- Orientation Attribute
The orientation attribute controls layout direction, switching between vertical and horizontal stacks.

- Layout Weight Usage
layout_weight enables child views to expand proportionally, improving flexible space distribution.

- Alignment and Gravity
layout_gravity controls child view alignment within the LinearLayout for better UI design.

## JAVA AND KOTLIN INTEGRATION

- Accessing Views in Java
Java uses findViewById to reference XML views, enabling dynamic UI manipulation and event handling.

- Accessing Views in Kotlin
Kotlin accesses views similarly with findViewById, providing concise syntax for UI element references.
