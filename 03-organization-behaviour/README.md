* **Attitudes influence behavior** — what people think often guides what they do.
* **Cognitive Dissonance** occurs when there’s a mismatch between attitudes and behavior (e.g., smoking despite knowing it's harmful).
* People generally strive for **consistency** between their attitudes and actions, and dissonance creates discomfort, leading them to adjust either the behavior or the attitude.

## 3. Summarize the Relationship Between Attitudes and Behavior

### **Factors Influencing the Importance of Attitudes**

* **Correspondence to Behavior**: The more closely an attitude aligns with a specific behavior, the stronger the relationship.
* **Accessibility**: Attitudes that are easily recalled are more likely to influence behavior.
* **Social Pressure**: Strong social norms can weaken the link between personal attitudes and behavior.
* **Personal Experience**: Attitudes formed through direct personal experience have a stronger impact on behavior.

## Define Job Satisfaction and Show How It Can Be Measured



### Job Satisfaction

* **Definition:**
  A positive feeling about a job that comes from evaluating its characteristics.
  It’s one of the most critical job attitudes and predicts many important business outcomes.


### Two Popular Approaches to Measuring Job Satisfaction

1. **Single Global Rating**

   * A simple, overall rating of job satisfaction on a scale (e.g., 1–5 from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree).

2. **Summation of Job Facets**

   * Measuring satisfaction by adding up feelings about different specific aspects or facets of the job (like pay, coworkers, work conditions, etc.).




## Summarize the Main Causes of Job Satisfaction

#### 1. Job Conditions

* Job conditions strongly contribute to satisfaction.
* Key factors include: interesting work, good supervisors, autonomy, variety, training, independence, control, interdependence, feedback, social support, and leader empowerment.
* Manager attentiveness, responsiveness, and support are especially strong predictors.
* Intrinsic aspects of the work, social interactions, and supervision play major roles.

#### 2. Personality and Individual Differences

* Positive core self-evaluations (belief in self-worth and competence) lead to higher job satisfaction.
* Negative core self-evaluations are linked to lower satisfaction, lower goal-setting, and giving up when facing difficulties.
* High career/job commitment and a good match between job nature and personal interests also boost satisfaction.

#### 3. Pay

* Pay influences job satisfaction only up to a certain point.
* Beyond a certain level of career maturity, pay has little impact on satisfaction.
* Money may provide temporary happiness but not lasting job satisfaction.





## Outcomes of Job Satisfaction


* **Job Performance**

  * Includes both quality and quantity of work.

* **Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB)**

  * Positive behaviors that go beyond job requirements.
  * The opposite is **Counterproductive Work Behavior** (negative, harmful actions).

* **Customer Satisfaction**

  * Happier employees often lead to more satisfied customers.

* **Life Satisfaction**

  * Job satisfaction can positively influence overall life satisfaction.




## The Impact of Job Dissatisfaction


* **Exit**

  * Leaving the organization as a response to dissatisfaction.

* **Voice**

  * Actively and constructively trying to improve the situation.

* **Loyalty**

  * Passively waiting and hoping for conditions to get better without taking action.

* **Neglect**

  * Passively allowing conditions to worsen, leading to behaviors like chronic absenteeism, tardiness, reduced effort, and more mistakes.





**Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB):**

* Actions by employees that **actively harm the organization**.
* Examples include:

  * Stealing
  * Aggressive behavior toward coworkers
  * Being late or absent

**Additional Outcomes:**

* Increased **absenteeism**
* Higher **employee turnover**




# Chapter 4: Emotions and Moods

### Why Were Emotions Ignored in Organizational Behavior (OB)?
